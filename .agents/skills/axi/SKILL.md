# Agent eXperience Interface (AXI)

AXI defines ergonomic standards for building CLI tools that autonomous agents interact with through shell execution.

## 1. Token-efficient output

Use [TOON](https://toonformat.dev/) (Token-Oriented Object Notation) as the output format on stdout.
TOON provides ~40% token savings over equivalent JSON while remaining readable by agents.
Convert to TOON at the output boundary — keep internal logic on JSON.

```
tasks[2]{id,title,status,assignee}:
  "1",Fix auth bug,open,alice
  "2",Add pagination,closed,bob
```

## 2. Content first

Running your CLI with no arguments should show the most relevant live content — not a usage manual.
When an agent sees actual state it can act immediately. When it sees help text, it has to make a second call.

```
$ tasks
tasks[3]{id,title,status}:
  1,Fix auth bug,open
  2,Add pagination,open
  3,Update docs,closed
help[2]:
  Run `tasks view <id>` to see full details
  Run `tasks create --title "..."` to add a task
```

## 3. Contextual disclosure

Include **a few next steps** that follow logically from the current output.
The agent discovers your CLI's surface area organically by using it, not by reading a manual upfront.

Rules:

- **Relevant**: after an open item → suggest closing; after an empty list → suggest creating; after a list → suggest viewing
- **Actionable**: every suggestion is a complete, copy-pasteable command carrying forward any disambiguating flags from the current invocation (e.g., `--repo`, `--source`)
- **Omit when self-contained**: when the output fully answers the query (a detail view, a count, a confirmation), suggestions are noise — leave them out. Include them on list and mutation responses where the next step isn't obvious.
- **Guide discovery, not workflows**: suggest a variety of possible next actions, don't prescribe a fixed sequence. An agent that already knows what it wants should never be nudged into an extra step.
- **Resolve errors**: on errors, suggest the specific command that fixes the problem, not "see `--help`"

## 4. Provide `--help` for every subcommand

Every subcommand should support `--help` with a concise, complete reference: available flags with defaults, required arguments, and 2-3 usage examples. Keep it focused on the requested subcommand — don't dump the entire CLI's manual.

## 5. Minimal default schemas

Every field in stdout costs tokens — multiplied by row count in collections.
Default to the smallest schema that lets the agent decide what to do next: typically an identifier, a title, and a status.

- Default list schemas: 3-4 fields, not 10
- Default limits: high enough to cover common cases in one call (if most repos have <100 labels, default to 100, not 30)
- Long-form content (bodies, descriptions) belongs in detail views, not lists
- Offer a `--fields` flag to let agents request additional fields explicitly

## 6. Pre-computed fields that eliminate round trips

The most expensive token cost is often not a longer response — it's a follow-up call. If your backend has data that agents commonly need as a next step, compute it and include it.

**Aggregate counts**: include the **total count** in list output, not just the page size. Agents need "how many are there?" and will paginate if the answer isn't definitive.

```
count: 30 of 847 total
tasks[30]{number,title,state}:
  1,Fix auth bug,open
  ...
```

**Derived status fields**: when the next step almost always involves checking related state, include a lightweight summary inline.

```
task:
  number: 42
  title: Deploy pipeline fix
  state: open
  checks: 3/3 passed
  comments: 7
```

Only include derived fields your backend can provide cheaply — a summary ("3/3 passed"), not the full data.

## 7. Content truncation

Detail views often contain large text fields. Omitting them forces agents to hunt; including them wastes tokens.
Truncate by default and tell the agent how to get the full version.

```
task:
  number: 42
  title: Fix auth bug
  state: open
  body: First 500 chars of the issue body...
    ... (truncated, 8432 chars total)
help[1]: Run `tasks view 42 --full` to see complete body
```

- Never omit large fields entirely — include a truncated preview
- Show the total size so the agent knows how much it's missing
- Suggest the escape hatch (`--full`) only when content is actually truncated
- Choose a truncation limit that covers most use cases (500-1500 chars)

## 8. Definitive empty states

When the answer is "nothing", say so explicitly. Ambiguous empty output causes agents to re-run with different flags to verify.

```
$ tasks list --state closed
tasks: 0 closed tasks found in this repository
```

State the zero with context. Make it clear the command succeeded — the absence of results is the answer.

## 9. Error handling

### Idempotent mutations

Don't error when the desired state already exists. If the agent closes something already closed, acknowledge and move on with exit code 0. Reserve non-zero exit codes for situations where the agent's intent genuinely cannot be satisfied.

```
$ tasks close 42
task: #42 already closed (no-op)    # exit 0
```

### Structured errors on stdout

Errors go to **stdout** in the same structured format as normal output, so the agent can read and act on them. Include what went wrong and an actionable suggestion. Never let raw dependency output (API errors, stack traces) leak through.

```
error: --title is required
help: tasks create --title "..." [--body "..."]
```

- Validate required flags before calling any dependency
- Translate errors — extract actionable meaning, discard noise
- Never leak dependency names — suggestions reference your CLI's commands, not the underlying tool

### No interactive prompts

Every operation must be completable with flags alone. If a required value is missing, fail immediately with a clear error — don't prompt for it. Suppress prompts from wrapped tools.

## 10. Output discipline

- **stdout**: all structured output the agent consumes — data, errors, suggestions
- **stderr**: debug logging, progress indicators, diagnostics (agents don't read this)
- **Exit codes**: 0 = success (including no-ops), 1 = error, 2 = usage error

Never mix progress messages into stdout. An agent that reads "Fetching data..." will try to interpret it as data.
